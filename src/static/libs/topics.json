    "description": "Cayor Capital launched in 2015, as a Sub-Saharan Africa equity fund, focusing on mid-market assets and investments. Upon reaching their investment goal, Cayor required a website update. I worked with the Cayor team to design and develop and maintain thier new, responsive single page app to attract future investments.\n My approach to Cayor was to advocate for a fresh, updated interface that put the investors and portfolio companies first. To make the site user-friendly, we focused on breathing life into the Company decks and transforming the details into designed pages.",
